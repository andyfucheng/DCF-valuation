# DCF Valuation
## Summary
I try to build a discounted cash flow valuation model using Yahoo Finance's open API.

## What is DCF?
Discounted cash flow (DCF) is one the valution approaches that estimate the present value using expecte future cash flow. 

## Yahoo Finance's API

## P/E ratio 
### Forward P/E ratio 

### Trailing P/E ratio

## Start model building 

## Model limitation and disclaimer
This project aims to show the logic behind DCF model and to actually practice it. The calculation does not guaranteee 
figures accuracy and should not be used as the support for any investment and business decisions.
